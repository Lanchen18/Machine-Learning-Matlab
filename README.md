This would be programming assignments from Machine Learning Course. I have modified most of the files and it will not work on your computer if you just copy it. Please respect the Code of Coursera.

"We strongly encourage students to form study groups, and discuss the lecture videos (including in-video questions). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However, the answers that you submit for the review questions should be your own work. For the programming exercises, you are welcome to discuss them with other students, discuss specific algorithms, properties of algorithms, etc.; we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student, nor show your solution code to other students."

I have modified some codes and renamed the file according to their functions. Mainly, you would find the following topics:

    1. Learning Regression Model with Polynomial Feartures
    2. Logistic Regression Model with Conjugate Gradient Descent
    3. Neuron Networks for Image Recognition
    4. SVM with Gaussian Kernel
    5. K-Means Algorithm and PCA
    6. Recommender System and Multivariate Gaussian Anomly Detection

These codes are done on my own and I tried to vectorize the code as much as possible.
